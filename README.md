I design and build intelligent systems that combine strong engineering fundamentals with advanced machine learning techniques. My work spans graph neural networks, transformer-based systems, and full-stack development.

---

## 💡 What I Work On

- Machine Learning & AI Systems (GNNs, Transformers, Diffusion Models etc...)
- Backend Development & REST APIs
- End-to-End ML Deployment (AI -> model → API → MERN)
- Scalable system design with clean engineering practices
